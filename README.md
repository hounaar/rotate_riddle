# rotate_riddle

## Instruction
Hi, this riddle is a game to get familiar with a important algorithm
If you know about this algorithm and how exaclty it works, this riddle would be a piece of cake
All you have to do is to follow all rules and orders to solve the riddle. 

For solving this riddle you need to know English letters and rotation algiruthms

## clues

we have some numbers :
```
227736000010010222811414500116226010522171725186
```
The sequence of the numbers are following an rotation algorithm and a sequence of English letters
e.g : a is 1, b is 2 , : is 000 , . is 001, / is 010
You need to know the main sentence of the numbers 

BUT KNOW THIS THAT THE FINAL SENTENCE IS A URL

when you found the link click on it and follow the rules of the link which means that YOU HAVE FOUND THE ANSWER.

Follow the instruction given in the URL to get your reward which is that you can set a free order on <a href="https://ketabarzooni.ir">ketab arzooni website</a>

Tip : you have to convert each number and rotate them depending the rotation algorithm that you choose
